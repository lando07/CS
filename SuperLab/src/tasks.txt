1. Get mainExec finished
2. get the condition-specific Execs coded with their localizations
3. Get interface built
4. Improve security and make good class design(like encapsulation)
5. Export all jar file with mainExec being the main file
6. Get additional labs appended into the execs as I finish them
7. Maybe add Practice Problems to them???
