## Getting Started

Hello! My name is Landon and here I have compiled all of my Labs of CS1 Adv. simply run the jar and check them out!

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains some things:

- `src`: the folder to maintain the main source code
- `lib`: the folder to hold my labs and objects as dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
